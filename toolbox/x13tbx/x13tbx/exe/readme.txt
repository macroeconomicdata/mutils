HOW TO OBTAIN X13AS PROGRAM

The X-13 toolbox for Matlab is merely a shell for interacting with the
x13as program as provided by the US Census Bureau. The 'exe' subdirectory
is the place that is supposed to host the x13as program.

The programs and tools can be downloaded free of charge from the website of
the US Census Bureau. The X-13 Toolbox contains a utility that downloads
all supported Census programs from the internet for you. Simply say
InstallMissingCensusProgram at the Matlab prompt and all files should be
downloaded, provided you are online and the Census website is online as
well. This works, however, only if you use a Windows computer. If you use a
different operating system, consult the Census website
(https://www.census.gov/srd/www/x13as/) for information on how to obtain or
compile a version suitable for you.

If all usable files are present, the exe sub-direcory should contain the
following files:
  x13as.exe
  x13ashtml.exe
  x12diag03.exe
  x12a64.exe
  x12a.exe
  libjpeg.6.dll
  libpng3.dll
  zlib1.dll
